# üê¶‚Äç‚¨õ Introduction to S.O.L.I.D. Principles

Welcome to the repository dedicated to the S.O.L.I.D. principles! These principles are fundamental to building robust, flexible, and maintainable software. Created by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob, the S.O.L.I.D. principles represent a set of guidelines that help developers write cleaner, more modular, and efficient code.

# üñç What are the S.O.L.I.D. principles?
S.O.L.I.D. is an acronym representing five software design principles:

- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

Each of these principles addresses a specific area of software design and, when applied correctly, helps create more flexible, scalable, and easy-to-maintain systems.
